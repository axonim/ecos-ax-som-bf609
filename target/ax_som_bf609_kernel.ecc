# EXAMPLE: unmask interrupt 28-31 means
# The lowest bit in the group is equals one if set.
# All others equal increasing powers of 2.
# The highest bit in the group equals 8 if set.
# The mask is the sum of all bits set.

# Tracing takes the form of text messages that are output

# that they are not required for the program to run.

# removing the overhead of that checking.
# It is possible to enable assertions and tracing
# independently.
# There are also options controlling the exact behaviour of
# the assertion and tracing facilities, thus giving users

# if the message box is already full. The other two are the
# ordinary put() function which will block if the message box
# is full, and a timed put() operation which will block for
# upto a certain length of time if the message box is currently
# full. The blocking versions require extra memory in the
# message box data structure and extra code in the other
# message box functions, so they can be disabled if the
# application does not require them. If this option is enabled
# then the system will always provide the blocking put()
# function, and it will also provide the timed put() function
# if thread timers are enabled.
